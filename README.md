# Human-Detection-using-Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients
Trained a model for Human Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients Algorithm

train_n.py --> specify  the input folder as a command line argument containing two folders named 'possdfsfdsf' and 'neg' containg positive and negative training images respectively 

test.py --> specify  the output folder as a command line argument containing images for testing

trained model is saved with extension ' .pkl'

Dataset for training and testing can be downloaded from : ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/lear/douze/data/INRIAPerson.tar
